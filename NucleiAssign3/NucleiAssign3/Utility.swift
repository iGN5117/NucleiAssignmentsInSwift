 1. Get the immediate parents of a node, passing the node id as input parameter.
 2. Get the immediate children of a node, passing the node id as input parameter.
 3. Get the ancestors of a node, passing the node id as input parameter.
 4. Get the descendants of a node, passing the node id as input parameter.

     
     5. Delete dependency from a tree, passing parent node id and child node id.
 6. Delete a node from a tree, passing node id as input parameter. This should delete all the dependencies of the node.
 

     
7. Add a new dependency to a tree, passing parent node id and child node id. This should check for cyclic dependencies.
 8. Add a new node to tree. This node will have no parents and children. Dependency will be established by calling the 7 number API.
